# Building-Skills-in-Cplusplus-OOD

The exercise in C++ object-oriented design, based on the great book by Steven F. Lott (with his kind permission), "Building Skills in Object-Oriented Design", version 4, published Mar 04, 2020, https://slott56.github.io/building-skills-oo-design-book. 

For now, only the first part of the three: Roulette, Craps and Blackjack, is implemented.
